            <h2><strong> Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</strong></h2>
        <p>Individualism, inclusivity, creative sharing, paying your dues, being resourceful and the willingness to just give things a go and having fun while you do it. Ideals to constantly consider are those of being self-aware, sensitive, and empathic. They are emotionally honest, creative, and personal.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</strong></h2>
        <p>In a previous business I had a client who was struggling to pay their bills. After some communication we decided to let them continue to purchase goods on a ‘Sale or Return’ basis. We did this because we valued them as a client and wanted to help them while they went through a rough patch.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong></h2>
        <p>At home my partner and I have developed a culture of love, truth and equity. My friends are all deeply involved in DIY music scenes. Those scenes have taught me about sharing, being resourceful, individualism and creativity, while paying your dues and respecting those that came before you.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong></h2>
        <p>I will seek help using the Think Like A Programmer model. First analyse the situation, develop a plan, and debug the problem. If I am not successful, I will try another methodology. If that fails I will reach out to other students or my Facilitator via Slack.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Provide a description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong></h2>
        <p>After taking an Enneagram Test I identified as a Four. At my best I am self-aware, sensitive, emotionally honest, creative, and personal. I have a desire to express myself and my individuality, to create and surround myself with beauty. At my worst I have problems with melancholy, self-indulgence, and self-pity that leads to hiding from others, disdain of those around me and erratic behaviour.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Please evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong></h2>
        <p>My strengths lie in finding creative solutions to problems, and surrounding myself with likeminded people. Limitations I need to keep in mind include the need to alway be correct, being open to failure (and failing in public) is the best way to learn. Keeping on task and limiting distractions will be important and I need to remember to enjoy the process of learning, instead of being in a rush to reach the end result.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</strong></h2>
        <p>Being creative when it comes to problems solving and learning will help immensely. Hitting obstacles and then working out ways to combat them, potentially in a different way to someone else will only benefit the learning experience. Being emotionally honest with my fellow students could be a challenge in group work, but will ultimately yield positive results because I have been truthful in the situation.</p>

        <h2><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong></h2>
        <p>I think of a time where a previous band I was in was having trouble coming to an agreement on how to start a song with a tricky time signature. The intro was free form, with the kick drum being inspired by the intense patterns of the genre footwerk. This led to the vocalist having trouble working out when the correct time to come in was and started to refuse to practise or perform the track. Seeing this I brought the problem up when the group was in a positive mood, both sides got brought up how they were feeling and we came to a compromise. In hindsight the compromise still had it’s issues but ultimately the best solution to the problem. I think more mediation and a reminder of why we were in the group and our collective goal would have helped the situation.</p>
