            <h2><strong> What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></h2>
            <p>Emotional intelligence has been defined, by Peter Salovey and John Mayer, as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior". This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. People with a high degree of emotional intelligence know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.</p>

            <h2><strong> How is it different to IQ?</strong></h2>
            <p>Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual capacities and it is generally understood that it cannot be altered. Your EQ determines how you interact and treat people, and can be worked on and improved over time. An interesting way to look at it is as if a person’s success in school depends on their IQ level, a person’s EQ level reflects their success in real life.</p>
            
            <h2><strong> Why is it important?</strong></h2>
            <p>EQ is important because it affects the way we think and feel. Through mindfulness, reflection and understanding a person can manage and adjust emotions and adapt to any environments.</p>
