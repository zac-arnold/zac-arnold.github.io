            <h2><strong> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></h2>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its connections or re-wire itself. Having an understanding of Neuroplasticity in a learning environment means that students understand that knowledge is not a set value, and that everybody has the capacity to learn. and that the more you  the better you will become at it.</p>

            <h2><strong> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</strong></h2>
            <p>I could begin practising tasks, leading to strengthened neural pathways. As Neurologist Judy Willis says, "Practice makes permanent. The more times the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes."</p>
            
            <h2><strong> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong></h2>
            <p>Sleep and Meditation, regular exercise, reading fiction, learning an instrument, dancing have all been linked to increasing your neuroplasticity. Thinking about a certain topic as well as practising new skills have also been linked to increased neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h2><strong> Discuss Growth Mindset - what it is and why it is relevant</strong></h2>
            <p>Psychologist Carol Dwek describes a fixed and growth mindset as “In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.” It’s relevant to learning in EDA as we are dealing with a large amount of new information and constantly tackling new and difficult challenges. If we are open to them and approach our learning with a ‘growth mindset’ then we will be much more likely to achieve.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></h2>
            <p>I will remember to embrace challenges. When I don’t come to a desired outcome I will remember the Carol Dweck term ‘Not Yet’.</p>

            <h2><strong> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></h2>
            <p>It was a good reminder to embrace challenges and persist in the face of setbacks.</p>

            <p>The diagram on the <a href="https://www.learninghub.ac.nz/study-skills/growth-mindset/">Learning Hub</a> page was helpful, I've saved it as a daily reminder.</p>
