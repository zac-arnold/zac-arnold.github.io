    <div class="leftdiv"><p>Before we begin trying to understand the best practises associated with using Classes and IDs within CSS we need to understand how each command functions.</p>
        <p>Both Classes and IDs can be used as a ‘hook’. They link and identifying CSS mark up to HTML elements, but there is a difference. Classes will permit you to utilize the same CSS styles on many HTML elements, whereas an ID is used to make unique changes to just one HTML element.</p>
            <p>There are similarities and differences when it comes to best practise for Classes and IDs. For optimal results both require correct naming conventions. Coders should try to choose descriptive names deriving from the stylistic change they are trying to implement. Names should be as short as possible but as long as necessary. Because of the collaborative nature of coding, naming needs to be easy to understand for others. </p>
                <p>As mentioned previously, IDs should be limited to just one HTML element. This is not a definitive rule, but it is widely accepted as users may come into bugs when adding JavaScript to projects. 
    A good rule of thumb is “each element can have only one ID, and each page can have only one element with that ID”. This is not the case for Classes, it is encouraged for them to be used in multiple scenarios. </p>

<p>
    Classes and IDs are keep on CSS Stylesheets. It is also important to keep them as concise as possible, enabling it to quickly download and aid browser parsing.
