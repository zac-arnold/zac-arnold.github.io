            <h2><strong> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem</strong></h2>

            <p> I hit a roadblock in the Built In Method - Capitalise Function challenge. I had a lot of trouble writing the code and I threw as many problem solving techniques as I could at it. I started with pseudocode, but soon found I couldn't work out how to use the .map object. I googled extensively and watched youtube tutorials but I couldn't get my head around the syntax. I checked the Sample Answer that was provided hoping I could work backwards but it was too dense for me to understand. After more googling I checked in with my facilitator who walked me through the task, and had me verbalise what was going on in his answer (like a in-person take on the Rubber Ducky Method). I was able to go back to my repl, and correctly use the right syntax, and solve the problem. 
            </p>

            <p> I ran the gamut of emotions throughout this process . At the beginning I was eager to work it out. That was followed by a big helping of frustration and finally relief once I had come to an understanding. 
            </p>    
            
            <p> The majority of code that I was using in the challenge was new to me. Know I have a better understanding of mapping, splitting and joining strings and arrays, as well as the  toUpperCase() + .subsstr(1) and toString commands.

            <h2><strong> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got solved a problem in an elegant way.</strong></h2>

            <p>I needed to write a set of code to find the multiples of 3, 5 and 15 and assign those multiples different words (Fizz, Buzz or Fizzbuzz). Using an if/else statement I was able to break this down so it was clear and easy to understand. Writing pseudocode has become my default when I begin working. This lead me to write myself clear instructions and create logical code. It was a confidence boost to breakdown half of the challenge quickly, and made me realise that writing and vocalising at the start of the problem solving process help you to gain clarity.

            <h2><strong> Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>Pseudocode 10/10</strong><p>
                <p>Pseudocode has become integral to how I code. I will use it throughout any coding problem.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Trying something 7/10</strong></p>
                <p>I mean you've gotta start somewhere right?</p>

                <p><strong>Rubber Ducky method 5/10</strong></p>
                <p>I've just started to realise how the Rubber Ducky Method forces you to fully understand a problem. You think you know how something works but that isn't true until you're able to explain it to yourself.</p>

                <p><strong>Reading error messages & Googling 8/10 </strong></p>
                <p>I've really relied on interpreting the error messages that I receive. This ties into Googling those messages. I've had mixed results when searching for answers as I'm still learning how to articulate the problems I'm encountering and interpret the answers I find.</p>

                <p><strong>Console.logging 5/10</strong></p>
                <p>I've only recently  started using Console.log as frequently as I should. This explains why I've been struggling in some of the challenges.</p>

                <p><strong>Asking your peers for help 4/10</strong></p>
                <p>There has been a couple of instances where I have reached out to the slack chat to ask for help and everyone has always been kind and quick to respond.</p>

                <p><strong>Asking coaches for help 7/10</strong></p>
                <p>I've definitely leaned on my facilitator Jo$eph for guidance throughout these sprints.</p>

                <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection 10/10</strong></p>
                <p>While it can seem like extra work and a bit embarrassing if you've made mistakes I'm a firm believer that only get better by analysing your actions.</p>
