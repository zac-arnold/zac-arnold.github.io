            <h2><strong>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</strong></h2>

            <h2><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></h2>
            <p>I've learnt that when faced with a challenge I need to actively remind myself to be resilient. I've come to find that I work best when  instructions  and variables are defined from the beginning of a task and that regular meditation and reflection are the basis for a healthy work / life balance.</p>

            <h2><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong></h2>
            <p>Values, empathy and self awareness play a huge role in learning and programming. I think that a lot of the internets problems are caused by not leading development with these traits.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></h2>
            <p>Being exposed to, and adopting Carol Dweck's 'Power of Yet' philosophy was a turning point for me. It's something that I remind myself constantly, especially if when I am struggling with a problem.</p>

            <h2><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></h2>
            <p>I found the 'flipped learning' experience challenging because it's a totally new way of thinking. Ultimately I think it is the reason why I've been able to retain so much new information.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></h2>
            <p>I think EDA has a strong focus on core learning for multiple reasons. It preps students for days of problem solving based work, and helps them stay motivated through the accelerated learning environment.</p>

            <h2><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></h2>
            <p>Not at all. Knowing your personality, and how it works (especially within groups environments) can only benefit a student in the long run.</p>

            <h2><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></h2>
            <p>The long term goal is to find employment once I leave Dev Academy, so I can provide for myself, my partner and my family. I'd seek an opportunity to become a better coder by getting into situations where I can put in the hours needed to upskill. Ideally I'd like to work in sectors that deal in Music, Environmentalism, Education or the Union movement.</p>

            <h2><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></h2>
            <p>I think that my evaluations of my strengths and limitations from <a href="https://zac-arnold.github.io/blog/sprint2-cultural.html">Sprint 2</a> were accurate. I do work best when I adhere to a routine and I can minimise distraction. I've also discovered that I enjoy being in collaborative environment, and have struggled with the isolation of Foundations. I look forward to Bootcamp and re-arranging my routine to accommodate my new surroundings.</p>

            <h2><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></h2>
            <p>I think maintaining resilience in difficult learning environments and keeping focused will be my biggest non-technical challenges in Bootcamp.</p>

            <h2><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong></h2>
            <p>I'd like to develop my communication and self awareness skills. I think that will aid me best for when I pair with others or work in groups.</p>

            <h2><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong></h2>
            <p>I commit to being present throughout Bootcamp, taking time to asses the workload and to change my routine accordingly. I will move into all situations with an open mind and empathy.</p>
