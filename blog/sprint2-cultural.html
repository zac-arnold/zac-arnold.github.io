            <h2><strong> What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong></h2>
        <p>My baseline goal is to complete EDA with the skills needed to find employment as a Junior Web Developer. Having changed career paths I am open to everything, and expect to find my path as I progress through EDA. That being said, I would jump at any opportunity to work with companies in areas like Music, Environmentalism, or Unionism.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong></h2>
        <p>I would like to develop more skills for working in large group environments as well as focus on ways to build concentration.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Describe your own strengths and limitations, and provide commitment to how you will manage the workload in the EDA programme. </strong></h2>
        <p>I know I work best when I adhere to a routine. With that in mind I start every week by checking how much time each Sprint has been allocated. I then break that down accordingly over five days (knowing that if I get stuck I have Saturday and Sunday as a backup). To keep myself in check throughout the programme I will make sure to stay on task, keep times allocated and take lots of breaks. When self-consciousness rears I will see it for what it is and make sure to dive into that situation.</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Provide a commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong></h2>
        <p>I will seek help using the Think Like A Programmer model. First analyse the situation, develop a plan, and debug the problem. If I am not successful, I will try another methodology. If that fails I will reach out to other students or my Facilitator via Slack.</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Provide a description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</strong></h2>
        <p>I would expect the facilitation team to be professional, to lead with empathy, understanding and <em>a lot</em> of patience. </p>
    
        <h2><strong>Please provide scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</strong></h2>
        <p>I try to start each morning with a long distance walk and be ready to begin work anywhere from 9AM-10AM. I have a small independent record label that I manage during the evenings.</p>
